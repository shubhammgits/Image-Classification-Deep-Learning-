# Image Classification with Deep Learning – Happy vs Sad Detection

A **deep learning-based image classification project** that detects emotional expressions — **Happy 😊** or **Sad 😢** — in facial images using **TensorFlow, Keras, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
This is a **backend-only implementation** built with Python, structured for scalability, and ready for integration with a GUI, API, or web application.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages a **CNN model** to classify human facial expressions into two categories.  
It serves as a foundational implementation for more advanced emotion recognition systems.  

The model is trained on a dataset of **happy and sad faces**, with preprocessing techniques applied to improve accuracy and generalization.  

**Potential Use-Cases:**
- Emotion-aware apps and chatbots  
- Smart surveillance cameras  
- Mental health monitoring tools  
- Interactive learning platforms

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Classify facial images into **Happy** or **Sad** categories  
- ✅ Train and evaluate a **CNN model** using TensorFlow + Keras  
- ✅ Implement **image preprocessing and augmentation**  
- ✅ Provide modular backend code for scalability  
- 🚧 Planned: Extend to multi-class emotions (anger, fear, surprise, etc.)  
- 🚧 Planned: Deploy via Flask/Django REST API or Streamlit/Gradio GUI

## 📐 Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:  
1. **Conv2D + ReLU Layers** – Extract features from facial images.  
2. **MaxPooling2D Layers** – Downsample feature maps.  
3. **Dropout Layers** – Reduce overfitting.  
4. **Flatten Layer** – Convert features into a dense vector.  
5. **Dense Layers** – Learn higher-level patterns.  
6. **Sigmoid Output Layer** – Binary classification (Happy/Sad).
