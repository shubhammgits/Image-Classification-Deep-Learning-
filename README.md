# Image Classification — Happy vs Sad — Deep Learning

A simple backend for an image classification system built using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. It detects whether an uploaded image shows a happy or sad expression. There’s currently no GUI—this is purely the model and inference backend.

##  Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Classifies images as either *Happy* or *Sad*.
- Built with **TensorFlow 2.x**, **Keras Sequential API**.
- Lightweight and modular—with scope to add GUI or API later.

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pillow (for image handling)
- Optionally: OpenCV, matplotlib (for preprocessing or visualization)

##  Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
