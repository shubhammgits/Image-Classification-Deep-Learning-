Deep Learning-Based Emotional Expression Classifier
A deep learning project designed to classify emotional expressions as either Happy 😊 or Sad 😢 from images. This backend-only implementation is built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, serving as a foundational model for more complex emotion detection systems.

🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a robust image classification model that leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotional expressions in images. The project is meticulously structured for scalability and is ready for integration with a GUI or web service. It's an excellent starting point for developers and enthusiasts looking to build emotion-aware applications, smart camera software, or experiment with CNNs for image classification.

✨ Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with the TensorFlow and Keras Sequential API for accurate image classification.

Emotional Classification: Specifically trained to distinguish between two key emotional states: Happy 😊 and Sad 😢.

Backend-Only Implementation: The current codebase is a pure backend solution, providing a clean and modular foundation.

Scalability: The project structure is designed to be easily extensible for future additions of more emotional categories or complex features.

Educational Foundation: Provides a clear, well-commented codebase ideal for learning and understanding the fundamentals of deep learning and image classification.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

TensorFlow: The primary deep learning framework.

Keras: Used for building and training the neural network model with its user-friendly API.

Numpy: For efficient numerical operations.
