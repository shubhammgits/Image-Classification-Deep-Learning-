# 📷 Image Classification with Deep Learning – Happy vs Sad Detection

A deep learning-based image classification project designed to detect emotional expressions — **Happy 😊** or **Sad 😢** — in images using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and the **Sequential API**. This is a backend-only implementation built with Python, structured for scalability, and ready for integration with a GUI or web service.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify facial expressions as either *happy* or *sad*. It serves as a foundational model for more complex emotion detection systems.

Whether you're building an emotion-aware app, smart camera software, or experimenting with CNNs for image classification, this project provides a clean and educational base.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Classify uploaded facial images into **Happy** or **Sad** categories
- ✅ Use a deep learning model (TensorFlow + Keras)
- ✅ Build and train using custom datasets
- ✅ Modular, backend-focused Python code
- 🚧 GUI/Web integration planned (not implemented yet)
